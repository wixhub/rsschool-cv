## Summary

With over 6 years of experience in software development, I most focused on developing web applications using Angular framework and TypeScript. When I am solving a problem I am always searching for a better way. Depending on the requirements it could be either the faster solution or the higher quality result. I constantly improve my qualifications and regularly update my professional knowledge following rapid development of web technologies.
